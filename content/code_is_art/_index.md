# Code == Art

## What

This is a small Boise meetup to talk about art in relation to programming.

At each meeting the presenter will showcase a different artist. We'll cover:

* Introduction to the artist, who they are, their personal and artistic story
* Presentation of curated selection of artist's works
* Discussion about some of the computational techniques used

If anyone attending the meeting has digital works in progress to share we
can also have a section for audience presentation of their works.

## When

First meeting was Wednesday, Aug. 6, 6-7pm, 2025, and covered [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/).

Next meeting is Wed., Sep. 3, 6-7pm.

The intention is to have the meeting monthly on the first Wednesday of each month.

## Where

[*Library! at Bown Crossing*, Martie Brennan Multipurpose Room, 2153 E. Riverwalk Dr. Boise, ID 83706](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3nG9WhnpjW6GZ9Gr5).

## Who

I'm Nathan Whitehead, the organizer. I'm an independent software developer
specializing in mathematical programming. I'm interested in how computers and
art intersect, I feel like this is still an underexplored area even though
people have been using computers to make art for decades now. This meetup is an
excuse to talk about cool artists and discuss how they are creating their work.
I'm particularly interested in artwork that involves algorithms and code as
an integral part of the artwork.

You should stop by if you are interested in seeing some cool art and hearing
about the techniques used to create it. You don't need to be an expert
programmer.

Some of the techniques I'm interested in:
* Shaders and pixel filters
* Pseudorandom number generation
* Iterated function systems (IFS)
* Cellular automata
* Tiling and tessellation
* Vector flow fields
* Fractals
